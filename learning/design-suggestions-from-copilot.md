*So initially the application will load some data from the server (might just be a static JSON file, or might load something from Cosmos). This data will be effectively a list of audio files. The application, once it has loaded the list, will compare the list against what it has cached locally and download any audio files it doesn't already have. That's the main thing I want to achieve at this point.*

That sounds like a solid foundation for your PWA! The workflow you're describing—fetching a list of files, checking against a cache, and downloading missing ones—aligns well with service workers and local storage strategies.

Here’s a rough breakdown of how you might approach it:

# Fetching the Data

If you're using a static JSON file, a simple HttpClient request will do the trick.

If pulling from Cosmos DB, you might expose an API endpoint that serves the list of files.

# Caching the List

You can store the fetched list in IndexedDB for better persistence.

Alternatively, local storage works, but IndexedDB is more robust for structured data.

# Comparing Against Local Storage

Retrieve the cached list and compare filenames or checksums.

Identify which files are missing and need downloading.

# Downloading & Storing Audio Files

Use the Fetch API or HttpClient in Blazor to download audio files asynchronously.

Cache them using IndexedDB or store them as Blob URLs for quick access.

# Service Worker for Offline Support

A service worker can intercept requests and ensure cached audio files are served when offline.

You can register a service worker in Blazor by modifying the service-worker.js file.

Would you like help structuring any specific part of this setup? Your plan is shaping up to be a practical introduction to PWA features!
