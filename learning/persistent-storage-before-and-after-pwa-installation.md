*Is there a difference in the way that my application will store downloaded audio files before and after it is installed? I'm concerned there might be some wrinkles around this.*

There **can** be differences in how your Progressive Web App (PWA) stores and accesses downloaded audio files before and after installation, mostly due to browser security policies and access to more persistent storage.

# Before Installation (Running as a Web App in the Browser)
Your Blazor WASM app will have access to IndexedDB, localStorage, and Cache API.

Storage is sandboxed per origin, meaning:

Files can be cached via the Service Worker (but subject to browser eviction).

IndexedDB allows structured storage but isn’t ideal for large files.

No direct access to the file system.

The browser manages storage quotas, and data may be cleared if the user’s device is running low on space.

# After Installation (Running as a PWA)
Once the PWA is installed, it can behave more like a native app, with advantages such as:

Better persistent storage via File System Access API (if supported by the user's browser).

Background Sync allows for asynchronous downloads, even when the app isn’t open.

Storage persistence (depending on browser settings) means data is less likely to be automatically cleared.

# Possible Wrinkles to Watch Out For
## Storage Quotas Vary By Platform

Installed PWAs may request persistent storage, but this isn't guaranteed across all browsers.

Some mobile browsers limit IndexedDB space more strictly than desktop browsers.

## Service Worker Cache Expiry

Files stored in Cache API may be evicted if the browser decides it's reclaiming space.

## File System Access API Limitations

Some browsers (like Safari) don’t support File System Access API, meaning you’re stuck with IndexedDB for persistent storage.

# Best Approach for Your Case
Since your Blazor PWA focuses on caching audio files, consider:

Using IndexedDB for metadata, but Cache API or File System API for actual files.

Requesting persistent storage when installed (`navigator.storage.persist()`).

Keeping files small or offering manual download options to guarantee they aren't lost.
