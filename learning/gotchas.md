# appsettings.json in Blazor WebAssembly projects
Recall that the application runs entirely client-side, and so it needs the appsettings file to be downloaded to the browser too. Consequently, it's publically available at:
```
https://yourapp.com/appsettings.json

```
**Do not** put anything sensitive in any appsettings file!
