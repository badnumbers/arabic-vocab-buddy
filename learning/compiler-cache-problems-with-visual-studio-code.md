# The problem
On a couple of occasions I've found build errors that persist after I've fixed the underlying code issue. For example, I had an issue where the compiler insisted that a class called `EnvironmentManager` did not implement an interface called `IEnvironmentManager`, long after I fixed these files. On a couple of occasions I have found that renaming affected files fixes the build, and that renaming them back works fine after this.

# What Copilot says
*Okay, I found - as I have in a similar situation before - that renaming the class and interface fixed the build, and changing the names back did not break it subsequently. So I'm pretty sure there is some kind of compiler cache problem. Have other people reported similar issues with developing .NET applications in Visual Studio Code?*

Yes, many developers have reported similar issues with stale compiler caches, especially when working with .NET projects in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or when using the dotnet CLI outside of Visual Studio (Windows).

Common symptoms:
* The compiler reports errors that do not match the current code.
* Renaming classes or interfaces "fixes" the problem, but the error returns if you revert the name. *[Actually this is not what I have found.]*
* Cleaning and rebuilding (`dotnet clean && dotnet build`) sometimes helps, but not always.
* The problem is more common when using VS Code, Rider, or other editors that do not have the full Visual Studio integration.

Why does this happen?
* .NET build artifacts (`/bin`, `/obj`) can get out of sync, especially after renames, moves, or merges.
* OmniSharp (the language server powering C# in VS Code) can have stale caches or not pick up changes immediately.
* Multiple interface/class definitions (even in hidden or backup files) can confuse the build.
* IDE cache: VS Code and OmniSharp sometimes need to be restarted to clear their internal state.

Solutions and best practices:
* Run `dotnet clean` and `dotnet build` after major changes.
* Delete the `/bin` and `/obj` folders manually if issues persist.
* Restart VS Code and/or reload the C# extension (OmniSharp).
* Make sure there are no duplicate or hidden files with the same class/interface names.
* If using git, ensure no merge conflict files (`*.cs.orig`, etc.) are present.

Summary:
Yes, this is a known and sometimes frustrating issue. Cleaning, rebuilding, and restarting VS Code usually resolves it. If you encounter persistent problems, deleting `/bin` and `/obj` and restarting the IDE is the most reliable fix.
